		/*	Java divides the operators into the following groups:
		  
			Arithmetic operators
			Assignment operators
			Comparison operators
			Logical operators
			Bitwise operators
		*/
		
		/*	Arithmetic Operators - Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	Name			Description								Example
+			Addition		Adds together two values				x + y	
-			Subtraction		Subtracts one value from another		x - y	
*			Multiplication	Multiplies two values					x * y	
/			Division		Divides one value by another			x / y	
%			Modulus			Returns the division remainder			x % y	
++			Increment		Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
--			Decrement		Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x
		 
		A list of all assignment operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Example		Same As
=			x = 5		x = 5	
+=			x += 3		x = x + 3	
-=			x -= 3		x = x - 3	
*=			x *= 3		x = x * 3	
/=			x /= 3		x = x / 3	
%=			x %= 3		x = x % 3	
&=			x &= 3		x = x & 3	
|=			x |= 3		x = x | 3	
^=			x ^= 3		x = x ^ 3	
>>=			x >>= 3		x = x >> 3	
<<=			x <<= 3		x = x << 3

		Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, 
		because it helps us to find answers and make decisions. The return value of a comparison is either true 
		or false. These values are known as Boolean values
		
Operator	Name						Example	
==			Equal to					x == y	
!=			Not equal					x != y	
>			Greater than				x > y	
<			Less than					x < y	
>=			Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=			Less than or equal to		x <= y

		You can also test for true or false values with logical operators. Logical operators are used to 
		determine the logic between variables or values:

Operator	Name			Description													Example	
&& 			Logical and		Returns true if both statements are true					x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 			Logical or		Returns true if one of the statements is true				x < 5 || x < 4	
!			Logical not		Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true		!(x < 5 && x < 10)
