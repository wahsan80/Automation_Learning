Test NG

Make sure you have Test NG installed and/or configured within Eclipse and/or Project 

* Will add how to do that in later part

* Make sure that TestNG version is compatible. Last 2.3 versions are usually good to work with. 
* Starting with version 7.7.1 (or look within the pom.xml file)
* Relevant dependencies need to be copied from Maven Repository and added into the pom.xml file.

2 Options with TestNG within the Project

1. Create TestNG class (Creates a new class with all the relevant annotations)
This provides ready to use template. Just change the method names for better understanding. 

Right Click on Project Name or (package name within src/test/java) -> TestNG -> Create TestNG class

2. Convert to TestNG (Converts an existing class with relevant annotations.)

Right Click on Project Name or (package name within src/test/java) -> TestNG -> Convert to TestNG

TestNG annotations in execution priority are: 
Before: @BeforeSuite, @BeforeClass, @BeforeMethod, @BeforeTest
Test: @Test
After: @AfterSuite, AfterTest, AfterClass, AfterMethod
* Doesn't matter how you write the code or methods, code will be executed with the priority. 
* TestNG will replace the main() method in the class and will become the driver of the class with it's priority 
annotation. 
* Helps with the execution and control flow of the program. 

Key Words:

@Test (priority = 1) = sets the priority for the test cases for execution. 
@Test (enabled = false) = skips or bypass the test case
@Test (enabled = true) = Ensures that test gets executed
@Test (invocationCount = n) = n is the number of times code need to get executed. 
@Test (dependsOnMethods = "specifyTestCaseName") = specify the name of the parent test method on which the test 
                                                 = should be dependent.
Assert.fail = terminates the code/program at this execution stage, or only test case? 
alwaysRun = true = Ensures that this test case is run as a must case scenario.
