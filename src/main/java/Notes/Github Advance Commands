Git Recap

rm -rf .git [this will delete the .git hidden folder in present directory]
git add -A [This will add everything]
git add --a [This will add everything]
git commit -m "firstcommit" [This will make the files committed]
git remote add origin git@github.com:wahsan80/Git-Working.git [Only when you are pushing the code the very first time]
git push -u origin master [This will show your code in the github repo]

Only to add modified/new files/changes, we'll use the following command

git add . 

git working pattern

Untracked files >> Staged files >> Committed Files >> Moved to Master

Skipping the staging area for a modified file 

git commit -a -m filename [Always remember only a modified file can be made to skip staging. Untracked file can't]

git pull origin master - fetches commits from the master branch of the origin remote (into the local origin/master 
branch), and then it merges origin/master into the branch you currently have checked out. `git pull` only works if 
the branch you have checked out is tracking an upstream branch.

Fir the first time please do 'Git clone'

git clone https://github/seleniumpandaofficial/Repo1

git pull https://github/seleniumpandaofficial/Repo1
