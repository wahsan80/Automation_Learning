Difference between Architecture of Selenium 3 & Selenium 4

With the release of Selenium 4 there has been some significant Differences between the Selenium 3 and 4 which 
are highlighted below:

1. Communication between client-server: Selenium 3 architecture uses JSON Wire protocol to transfer 
information from the client to the server over HTTP. This protocol is used to serialise and deserialize 
object’s data to JSON format and vice versa respectively. However, Selenium 4 has dropped the JSON Wire 
protocol to ensure direct communication between client and the server.

2. W3C compliant: Selenium 3 does not fully adhere to W3C guidelines whereas Selenium 4 is fully W3C compliant
as it acts in accordance with the W3C standards and guidelines.

3. Selenium Grid: In Selenium Grid 3, testers are bound to start the hub and node jars every time they need to 
execute the test automation. On the contrary, in Selenium Grid 4, hub and node jars are packed in a single jar
and it is not required for the testers to start it each time they need to execute the automation tests.

4. ChromeDriver: In Selenium 3 class ChromeDriver directly extended RemoteWebDriver class however in Selenium 4
ChromeDriver class extends ChromiumDriver. 

5. Selenium IDE: Selenium IDE is a record and play tool which only supported the Firefox browser in Selenium 3.
In Selenium 4, it supports Chrome browser along with Firefox. New Plug-in system, allows any browser to easily
plug into the new Selenium IDE with its locator strategy and IDE plugin. It also allows parallel test 
execution and provides metrics on the total tests executed, as PASS/FAIL status.

6. Relative Locators: Relative Locators newly introduced in Selenium 4 allows locating elements located near to
the location of other web elements on the page with the help of methods such as above(), below(), toLeftOf(), 
toRightOf(), near(). Selenium 3 lacked this feature.

7. ChromeDevTools Protocol (CDP): Selenium 3 has no support for ChromeDevTools Protocol. Selenium 4 supports 
CDP which provides access to a wide range of advanced browser debugging and automation capabilities. Testers 
can benefit from features such as DOM inspection, Performance profiling and network traffic analysis.
