TestNG Parameterization

Parameterization is an execution strategy that runs a test case automatically multiple times with various input 
values. The test design provides the provision to read data from a file or database rather than hard-coded values.

In TestNG, there are two ways by which to achieve parameterization:

1. With the help of Parameters annotation and TestNG XML file
@Parameters({“name”, “searchKey”})

2. With the help of DataProvider annotation
@DataProvider(name= “searchProvider”)
