Understanding Constructors

Java Constructors

A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an 
object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.

Note that the constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void).

Also note that the constructor is called when the object is created.

All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for 
you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.

Constructor Parameters

Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes. You can have as many parameters as 
you want.
