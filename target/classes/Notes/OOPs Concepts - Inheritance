Inheritance

Java Inheritance (Subclass and Superclass)
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance 
concept" into two categories:

subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
To inherit from a class, use the 'extends' keyword.
