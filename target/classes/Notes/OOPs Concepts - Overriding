Overriding in Java

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overriding-in-java/

In Java, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of 
a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass 
has the same name, the same parameters or signature, and the same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its 
super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.

Example:

Animal (Parent Class)
data 1
move()
eat()

Dog (Sub Class)
data 2
move() -> Overriding
bark()

Method overriding is one of the ways by which Java achieves Run Time Polymorphism. The version of a method 
that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it. If an object of a parent class is 
used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed, but if an object of the 
subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed. In other words, 
it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable) that determines which 
version of an overridden method will be executed.
