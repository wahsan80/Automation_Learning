Abstraction in Programming - Definition

Abstraction in computer science is the process of removing elements of a code or program that aren't relevant
or that distract from more important elements. Abstraction refers to looking at something to maintain the 
general form or meaning while reducing the presence of specific details.

Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to
reduce complexity and increase efficiency. In the same way that abstraction sometimes works in art, the object 
that remains is a representation of the original, with unwanted detail omitted.
