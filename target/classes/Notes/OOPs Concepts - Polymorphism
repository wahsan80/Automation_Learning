Polymorphism

https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_polymorphism.asp#:~:text=Polymorphism%20means%20%22many%20forms%22%2C,methods%20to%20perform%20different%20tasks.

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by 
inheritance.

Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to 
perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals 
could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig 
oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):

Inheritance -> Polymorphism

Types of Polymorphism: -
1. Compile Time Polymorphism/ Static Polymorphism
2. Run Time Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism

Criterias to attain Compile (Static) Time Polymorphism
1. Achieved by Method Overloading
2. Method name should be same, Class should be same, Different Arguments/Parameters

Criterias to attain Run time (Dynamic) Polymorphism
1. Achieved by Method overriding
2. Method name should be same, Class should be different, Same arguments/parameters
