Data Structures:
Way in which you can store your data efficiently [time and space complexities]

Types of Data Structures:-
1. Primitive DS (boolean, int, char, short, byte, float, long, double)
2. Non Primitive DS
	2.1 Linear DS
		String, Array, List, Set, Queu, ArrayList, LinkedList, HS, etc
	2.2 Non-Linear DS
		Graph, Tress
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Arrays can store both primitive and non-primitive (objects) type of data 
	Collection frameworks can only store non-primitive
2. Arrays can store homogeneous data type

Collection Framework (API)
Collection - It is the single entity or object which can store multiple data 
Framework - It represents the library (It has pre-defined interfaces, abstract classes, classes, methods)

2 main parts
java.util.Collection
java.util.Map

Collection - it is an interface. It is the root interface present in java.util.package
Collections - It is a utility class. This contains only static methods

Please Study at least these: -

ArrayList
LinkedList
HashMap
Set
