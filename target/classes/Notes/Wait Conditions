While running Selenium tests, it is common for testers to get the message “Element Not Visible Exception“. This 
appears when a particular web element with which WebDriver has to interact, is delayed in its loading. To prevent
 this Exception, Selenium Wait Commands must be used.

In automation testing, Selenium Webdriver wait commands direct test execution to pause for a certain length of
 time before moving onto the next step. This enables WebDriver to check if one or more web elements are 
 present/visible/enriched/clickable, etc.
